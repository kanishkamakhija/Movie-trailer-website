## Downloading
To help you generate a website that displays these movies, we have provided a starter code repository that contains
a Python module called fresh_tomatoes.py. To get started, fork this [repository](https://github.com/udacity/ud036_StarterCode/blob/master/fresh_tomatoes.py) to create your own copy in GitHub. Then clone your ud036_StarterCode repository to work on this project locally on your computer. The fresh_tomatoes.py module has a function called open_movies_page that takes in one argument, which is a list of movies, and creates an HTML file which will display all of your favorite movies.
